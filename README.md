CS255 – Systems Analysis and Design Portfolio Reflection

DriverPass Project Summary:
The client, DriverPass, wanted an online system to help students pass their driving tests by offering both online lessons and in-person scheduling with instructors. My role was to gather requirements, design system diagrams, and document how the program would meet the client’s needs.

What I Did Well:
I organized the user and system requirements clearly and used UML diagrams that showed the relationships between students, packages, and lessons. My system design document was well-structured and easy to follow.

What I Would Revise:
If I could improve something, I would add more details about the testing and maintenance processes. That would make the documentation stronger and more realistic for future developers.

Interpreting User Needs:
I reviewed the client’s interview carefully and translated their main goals—such as lesson scheduling, package options, and user progress tracking—into specific features in my diagrams. Considering user needs is key to making sure the system is practical and solves real problems.

Approach to Designing Software:
I start with user requirements, then build diagrams to plan the logic and structure. I like using Agile ideas such as feedback and iteration to keep designs flexible. In the future, I’ll continue using user stories and UML diagrams to design systems that are efficient and user-friendly.
